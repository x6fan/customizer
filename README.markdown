- Parts obtainable by rescuing reploids no longer permanently missable
- Edit souls required for rank upgrades and event triggers to reduce grinding
- Enable Nightmare Zero Lvl.4 encounter during normal gameplay
- Mark injured reploids as rescued, missing or dead by default
- Customization of extra lives and continues
- Dialogue skipping

He also released a [data file] documenting the tweaks and a [graphical patching utility] that lets players customize their Mega Man X6 game.

This Python 3 script implements a command-line tweaking tool for Mega Man X6.
